Mushroom Classification
![mushroom](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a418616-add8-4c5f-891a-da921382a4e4)

Mushroom Classification to poisonous and edible based on attributes such as cap shape, odor, cap color, ring type, habitat, etc.
Data cleaning, handling, and EDA are done before classification.
